<p> <strong> 1. Introduction to the Web and HTML  </strong> </p> 
  <b> 1.1	 How the Internet works </b> <br> <p> 
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML (Hyper text markup language). Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them. <br> 
<em> Note:</em> HTML = plain <b> text + markup </b>  (the way it looks)<br> 

 Most web pages consist of HTML, but but they can also contain plain text, images, videos, music or links to other pages. 
</p> 
<p> <b> 1.2	Coding </b> </p> 
Writing code means translating your thoughts into a language the computer can understand. However, computers are <em> really stupid </em> and will only do exactly what you tell them to, so be careful to get every detail right. 
<p> <b>1.3	HTML vocabulary </b> </p>  
  <b> Tag</b>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (<ö> for example) and a closing tag, (</ü>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <ö> tag).<br>
  <b> Element</b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
  <b>Attribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the <em> href attribute</em> of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write <a href="www.udacity.com"><br> </p>
